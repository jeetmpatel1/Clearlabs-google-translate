### ClearLabs Google Translate

#### Installation reqirements

1.  Install Python3 if not available
2.  Install ``pip install -r requirements.txt``
3.  Create your google cloud api key. Get the file and replace it with ``api-key.json``
4.  Type the content in ``sample_input.json``. Set the `text`, `source lanague` and `target language`
5.  ``python main.py``


#### This could have been done with Shell, Java CLI or any other language. But requriements didn't state for any specific language.So i used python for rapid development.
